## üåü About The Project

This project is a simple web application that provides users with a daily dose of inspiration through randomly selected Bible verses. Built with a focus on modern design and engaging user experience, it serves as a personal reflection tool and showcases robust front-end development skills.

My motivation behind building this was to create a serene and interactive digital space for daily spiritual nourishment, while simultaneously exploring advanced CSS techniques and dynamic JavaScript functionalities.

### üí° Key Features

* **Dynamic Theming:** Automatically switches between a "Serene Dawn" (light) theme during the day and a "Deep Contemplation" (dark) theme at night, based on the user's local time.
* **Interactive Card Flip:** Users can click on the Bible verse card to seamlessly flip it over and reveal the corresponding scriptural reference.
* **"New Inspiration" Button:** A dedicated button allows users to fetch a new, random Bible verse instantly, accompanied by an elegant word-by-word text animation.
* **Glass morphism UI:** Features a modern, frosted-glass interface design, enhancing visual depth and appeal.
* **Subtle Background Animations:** Incorporates gentle, ambient particle effects in the background for an immersive and calming visual experience.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized to provide a seamless and beautiful experience across all devices, from desktops to tablets to mobile phones.
* **Google Fonts Integration:** Utilizes custom typography from Google Fonts to ensure clear readability and a polished aesthetic.

### üõ†Ô∏è Built With

* **HTML5:** For semantic document structure.
* **CSS3:** Employing Custom Properties (CSS Variables) for dynamic theming, Flexbox and Grid for layout, advanced Animations (`@keyframes`, `transition`), `backdrop-filter` for glassmorphism, and `@media` queries with `clamp()` for responsive design.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For DOM manipulation, event handling, dynamic content (verse loading), time-based logic, and orchestrating complex UI animations.
* **Git:** For version control.
* **GitHub:** For project hosting and collaboration.
* **Google Fonts:** For custom typography.
